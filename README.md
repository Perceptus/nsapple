# Goal
nsapple was originally written to follow BG data from Nightscout.  It has morphed (mostly thru quick hacks) to add data from Loop. nsapple 2.0 is a first attempt to clean up the code base and make it more useable, reliable, less resource intensive and more responsive. 

# Requirements
* ios 11+
* watchos 4+ (supports series 1-5 watches)

# Release Notes
* Faster Performance - graphs are now built in Core Graphics directly on the watch versus using an offline graph creater (required by Watch os1).  
* Data Polling - data is only pulled from Nightscout when the time since the last BG reading is greater then 6 minutes.  Each time the watch is engaged, if the time is over 6 minutes all data is reloaded.  This leads to lower consumption of battery and data, and the UI looks a lot smoother.
* Error Messages - vastly improved error messaging, including the details of Loop failures.

* User Data Setup in ios Watch App 
* Support for mmol and for Nightscout Tokens
* Support for Overrides in the "JoJo" Loop Branch
* Runs on cellular, wi-fi, or connected to your phone. 
* Code - Some Rebasing, Improved Variable Naming, Better Error Handling.  This was a first step but needs more work.
* Vastly Improved App Install in Xcode - No More Editing !

# Setup
* Simply click on the blue nsapple project file in the top left corner to show the general tab (see below).
* Then for each of the four targets, click on the team dialog and choose your development team.  Everthing else is auto generated now, just like Loop.  
* Then, after choosing your phone and watch combination to build too, click the play button and install.  
* After the software installs on the phone and watch, go to the Watch App on your phone and click on the nsapple symbol in the list of apps installed on your phone.  Then input your site name, unit preference, and tokens (if needed). 
* Note - the ios App called nsapple is required but it doesn't actually do anything.

Colors Vary Depending on the Parameter Being Displayed 
* For the Dexcom BG, Color Indicates Level of BG.  Green 80-180, Yellow 65-80 or 180-250, Red <65 or > 250 mg/dL (or mmol / L equivalents)
* For "min ago" and the Loop / Pump Information, Color Represents Time Since Last Update from Loop.  Green 6 min or less, Yellow 6 to 15 min, and Red > 15 min.


# Future Work
This really depends on how many people find nsapple useful.  
* Rebase code to MVC versus prior hacks.  This code was my first attempt at a watchos/ios app in 2015, and its been suffering from a poor start :)
* Language support
* Care portal support
* UI improvements - the UI is quite spartan.  Clean up look and feel, use icons instead of text, etc. 
* OpenAPS support
